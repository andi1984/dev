[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is one of the [most popular](https://2020.stateofcss.com/en-US/technologies/css-frameworks/) CSS frameworks.

FYI: By the way, the german [Working Draft](https://workingdraft.de/464/) podcast recorded an episode about Tailwind yesterday.

I was using Tailwind approximately three years ago, made my first experience with the utility-first approach of it, but I wanted to check out the newest [Tailwind CSS v2.0](https://blog.tailwindcss.com/tailwindcss-v2) that came out November 2020.

[You can watch the stream recording on Youtube.](https://youtu.be/mQDs0ClIsD4)

If you want to try Tailwind on your own without setting it up on your local environment, there is also an [online playground](https://play.tailwindcss.com/) for it.

Have fun,

Andi
