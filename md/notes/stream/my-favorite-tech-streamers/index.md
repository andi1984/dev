I stopped watching TV nearly five years ago in favor of Youtube and Twitch content that I can choose myself.

In this note I want to share a list of tech streamers on Twitch that I regularly watch:

## German

- [Jens Kr√ºger](https://www.twitch.tv/jhkrueger) is a german scientist and a university professor in real life. The streams are feeling like having a 1-to-1 session during your study time.
- [DialogikTV](https://www.twitch.tv/dialogiktv) is a very funny, entertaining streamer doing a lot of Twitch related tech projects.

## English

- I follow [Salma](https://www.twitch.tv/whitep4nth3r) since a few weeks. Her
  streams are really cozy and welcoming.
- [Tim Beaudet](https://www.twitch.tv/timbeaudet) is an Indie gamedeveloper working on his own racing games. And he also does a lot of pair programming with
- [Codico](https://www.twitch.tv/codico) is a younger developer, lately streaming about setting up Vim and working on his speed typing tool [SpeedTyper](https://speedtyper.dev).
- [Stefan Judis](https://www.twitch.tv/stefanjudis) is a german based developer
  that occasionally streams on Twitch. He has a pretty [famous newsletter](https://www.stefanjudis.com/newsletter/) you
  should subscribe to as well!
- [Kitze](https://www.twitch.tv/thekitze) is the founder of
  [sizzy](https://sizzy.co/) and [React Academy](https://www.reactacademy.io/).
  I really like his unique humor. Lately he seems to be less streaming, but if
  you see him live, stop by and have a chat with him.
- [James Werner](https://www.twitch.tv/jmswrnr) is a senior software developer with various streaming topics, also playing video games from time to time.
- If you want to see a VIM power user, watch [The
  Primeagen](https://www.twitch.tv/theprimeagen)! He is so much talented in
  making up a funny, entertaining show while developing heavy complex code. For
  me he is a real master of Twitch dev entertainment.
- [Cassidoo](https://www.twitch.tv/cassidoo) is a keyboard fanatic, female
  streamer, working for Netlify. She does a lot of AMA and Just chatting
  streams, speaking about tech careers, news and of course... keyboards! She
  motivated me to buy a new mechanical keyboard, I'm currently writing this text
  with.
- [ClarkIO](https://www.twitch.tv/clarkio) is a super nice and funny developer.
  He is pretty famous for his alliance with the VSCode editor and his content
  around working with the editor. His streams are famous for [Clark's nice vocals](https://www.kliptok.com/clip/BraveAltruisticVelociraptorKappaRoss-2lZAJf5HB0YrkAW0). :)
- [BaldBeardedBuilder](https://www.twitch.tv/baldbeardedbuilder) aka. Michael
  Jolley is a "real" bald, bearded builder. He is a funny guy, mostly doing
  JS/Node related projects. Sometimes he seems to light aroma candles. :)
- [Jason Lengstorf](https://www.twitch.tv/jlengstorf) is for me THE most
  professional tech streamer out there with an amazing [schedule](https://www.learnwithjason.dev/schedule). He is normally
  always do streams where Jason invites partners that bring in their own topic.
  If you want to learn something new every week, you should learn together with
  Jason in his streams!

## Suggestions?

Do you have any suggestions to this list? Let me know! I'm always interested in
new tech streamers to watch and I really like to see so many technical streams
lately.

## Start streaming!

I [reported lately](../../../posts/personal/streaming/index) that I started
streaming end of 2020 and in case you're asking yourself whether to stream
yourself: _Do it if you want to do it!_

See you on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/andi1984)!

Greets,

Andi
