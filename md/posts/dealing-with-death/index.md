title: Dealing with death
template: blogpost.twig
---

A few weeks ago a good friend of mine died on COVID-19 when she was just 52 years old.

Beside all the personal loss this also affected me as a developer in my daily work.

## Career thoughts

This might sound inappropriate in this situation, but after some days after I got the message I also started thinking about myself.

### Counting working years

I started counting working years from now to the day I will be 52 years as well. Realizing that it's not much more than one decade left.

This sounds stupid - even to me - while writing this down now.

### "What do you want to achieve?"

Asking myself the question what I would like to "achieve" within my work time left.

I love my current job, but I was also asking myself whether this is what I want to do for the next 10 years.

"Could I achieve something 'more meaningful' within my developer career" and if so, could _I_ really achieve that?

Or is there more potential to achieve something within my spare time?

_I just got questions, no answers yet._

## Final words

The loss hurts so much! Questioning myself about my career path is just a very small, niche part of this process within myself.

_I lost a good friend, powerful woman and digital thinker way too early in her life._
