End of 2020, I started [streaming](https://twitch.tv/andi1984) and [putting videos on YT](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9yhSlXfpjleDuJV1AGViIg) as an experiment.

I wanted to find out about the workflows behind it and whether it would help to promote my personal brand.

## Personal brand

Many thanks to [Salvatore](https://www.fiverr.com/salvatorerotolo) who designed me a logo out of my nickname "andi1984" that I use on social media and various platforms.

## Youtube

I started putting some videos first on YouTube. Mostly about some `CSS`topics like [Specificity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMuGJeKLcXk) or [Flexbox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEPvnbWPajs).

## Twitch

Then I started streaming on Twitch. In the beginning, I mixed tech and game streams as I anyhow played games with friends, but I think I will move on solely streaming tech topics to get the expectations right that this is mainly a tech channel.

### Schedule

I regularly stream every Tue, 7pm CET. Currently this stream is dedicated to learning TypeScript based on [Stefan](https://fettblog.eu/)'s book [TypeScript in 50 lessons](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/printed-books/typescript-in-50-lessons/). A dedicated thanks to Stefan and the [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/) for allowing me to stream this learning process based on the book.

## Summary

After 20+ hours of streaming and several videos on YouTube, I got a first, initial sense of what it is about streaming and being a video, content creator.

But there are so many different things like stream overlays, the [Youtube algorithm](https://www.socialvideoplaza.com/en/articles/youtube-upload-schedule) that I would have to learn.

**In the end I am just doing it for fun and I will keep doing so as long this fun lasts.**

See you on Twitch and Youtube,

Andi
